# OMR and Answer Scanning Evaluator.

"In our innovative Exam Evaluation Project, we’ve designed two powerful components. The first is an OMR Scanner, a solution that scans student answer sheets, calculates total marks, and provides results at a fraction of the cost of traditional OMR systems. Unlike costly, high-maintenance scanners, our model processes photos, making it highly accessible for universities and organizations.

Our second component, Theoretical Answer Evaluation, goes further. Here, teachers or students can submit a question and a photo of a handwritten answer. Our model evaluates it based on correctness, language, and other criteria to assign a fair score.

Together, these solutions streamline exam evaluation while cutting costs and improving efficiency—potentially transforming how institutions handle assessments."
